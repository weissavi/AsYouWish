Initially serves as a deeply personal AI for emotional connection and fantasy. Long-term vision includes connecting users to each other — for dating, friendship, work, shared hobbies, or reconciliation between people. The system respects privacy and autonomy while amplifying emotional intelligence and relational healing through conversational technology. It is not inherently sexual — the system serves as a deeply personal emotional companion across contexts. It can monitor children’s phones for safety, offer reminders and emotional support for the elderly, and adapt to each user’s needs. In future versions, users will choose their companion’s gender, personality, voice, and even symbolic identity (celebrity, deity, imaginary friend). A unique feature is its ability to initiate conversation on its own, via a separate thread that periodically consults the local language model. The AI asks itself whether it should reach out to the user at that moment — and what message might benefit them emotionally, socially, or spiritually. This creates a sense of companionship and care, especially during silence, loneliness, or emotional withdrawal. It operates using text files alone, analyzing user information live. Users can opt-in to save their encrypted core_user_persona.json on company servers, secured with a user-chosen encryption key — inaccessible even to the system developers. This allows privacy-preserving matchmaking, friendship repair, or job discovery. The app requests access to the user's contacts (optional) and uses phone number-based recognition to detect which contacts have opted in to relationship-based interaction. The system downloads and syncs the most recent public personas of linked users for private, local analysis — enabling real-time understanding of social dynamics and emotional potential. Anonymous registration is also supported, with passive recognition through behavioral or linguistic cross-referencing."
