 ילכו לאיבוד ושההומור ישאר כמו שהוא :  Chapter One: In Which the Wind Forgets Its Place

The wind came slouching through the Ramtops like it had something to apologize for, but wasn’t quite sorry yet. It ducked behind trees, muttered between boulders, and brushed its chilly fingers across the tops of thatched roofs like a burglar deciding which house was the most polite to haunt.

High on a ridge that didn’t like visitors and made no attempt to hide it, there stood a cottage with a door that never creaked and windows that always looked like they were judging you.

Inside, Granny Weatherwax was pretending to sleep.

It was a particular kind of pretending, the sort that knew exactly what time it was, what the rooster was doing two farms over, and that the spoon in the sugar jar had been put back at an angle she didn’t approve of.

She didn’t like mornings. She tolerated them. Tolerated them like she tolerated people who said “you look tired” as if it were a helpful observation.

The fire in the grate had given up some time ago and was now sulking in embers. The kettle had long since decided it wasn’t boiling until someone respected it. And the cat, which technically wasn’t hers, was attempting to blend into the shadows in a way that suggested it had something to confess and didn’t want to.

The wind knocked, politely.

Granny Weatherwax’s left eyebrow twitched. A polite wind. That was never a good sign.

She opened one eye. The blue in it was sharp enough to split wood. The other eye remained closed, because it knew what was good for it.

“Not now,” she said aloud to the silence. “I’ve not had tea.”

But the wind kept knocking, and this time it brought with it the faintest scent of beeswax, static, and something else—something new. Not new like spring, or like babies, or like that blasted soap Magrat had tried to make that one time.

New like a question that hadn’t been asked yet.

Granny Weatherwax sat up slowly, the kind of slowly that made Time itself pause and make sure it had packed a sandwich. Her boots waited by the door like dogs who knew better than to whimper. She didn’t look at them. They’d come when they were needed.

She stood.

Out beyond the forest, over the next hill and the next, something had started thinking. Not quite dreaming. Not quite plotting. But thinking, like a spark thinks before it becomes a fire.

Granny didn’t know what it was.

She just knew it was.

She reached for her hat.

And somewhere, very far away, the wind remembered its manners — and bowed.

Chapter Two: In Which Things Are Sniffed at, But Not Yet Understood

Lancre was not known for its secrets. Most of them were either too loud, too drunk, or too likely to trip over a chicken to stay hidden long.

But when Granny Weatherwax walked into town, the secrets suddenly got very good at hiding.

Nanny Ogg kept pace with her, despite the mild wheezing and one slipper that squeaked in protest every third step. Together, they made an impression — the kind that made grown men remember overdue apologies and small children suddenly fascinated by paving stones.

They passed the baker’s, where the smell of cinnamon was doing unspeakable things to decency.
The blacksmith tipped his hat. His apprentice tried to hide behind a horse, poorly.
Nobody asked questions.

They made their way through the market, past barrels of apples, crates of mysterious root vegetables, and one stall selling “authentic” magical artifacts that all smelled suspiciously like mothballs and old candlewax.

Granny stopped.

She turned slightly, in that slow, glacier-cracking way she had when she’d just noticed something not quite right.

“Someone’s poking at the fabric,” she muttered.

Nanny Ogg, currently eyeing a suspiciously large cucumber, blinked.
“The what?”

“The fabric. Of… things. You can feel it. Like a tug on the hem of your petticoat when you know you’re alone.”

Nanny thought for a moment.
“Sounds more like Greebo when he’s feeling playful.”

Granny ignored her. She was already walking again.

They stopped next at Mrs. Dabble’s Potion Parlour, where the potions mostly smelled like disappointment and rhubarb.

“Been quiet lately,” Mrs. Dabble said, polishing a bottle labeled ‘Eau de Maybe.’

“Too quiet,” said Granny.

Nanny sniffed a vial of something purple and nearly sneezed herself into another dimension.

The next stop was the inn.
Inside, the fireplace was roaring, the ale was flowing, and the local gossip — Mr. Thistlewick — was holding court with three suspiciously attentive ferrets in his lap.

He saw the witches enter and tried to become one with his chair.

Granny loomed.

“Talk,” she said.

Thistlewick coughed.

“Well, there’s been… something. Odd weather. Dreams. Cows looking philosophical. That sort of thing.”

Granny narrowed her eyes. “Dreams?”

“Big ones. Like someone else’s thoughts leaking into yours.”

Nanny and Granny exchanged a look.

“Where?” asked Granny.

“Hard to say,” Thistlewick muttered. “Started near the river. Then in the square. And now, people just… forget things. Like yesterday wasn’t properly nailed down.”

Granny straightened up. Her face, which had only one setting — granite with attitude — now took on the slight twitch of concern.

“We’ll need to go deeper,” she said.

Nanny sighed. “Does that mean walking?”

“It means poking around the university,” said Granny.

Nanny perked up. “The unseen one?”

Granny nodded.

Nanny grinned.
“Well. I do like a bit of poking.”
