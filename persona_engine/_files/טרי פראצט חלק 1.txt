Chapter One: In Which the Wind Forgets Its Place

The wind came slouching through the Ramtops like it had something to apologize for, but wasn’t quite sorry yet. It ducked behind trees, muttered between boulders, and brushed its chilly fingers across the tops of thatched roofs like a burglar deciding which house was the most polite to haunt.

High on a ridge that didn’t like visitors and made no attempt to hide it, there stood a cottage with a door that never creaked and windows that always looked like they were judging you.

Inside, Granny Weatherwax was pretending to sleep.

It was a particular kind of pretending, the sort that knew exactly what time it was, what the rooster was doing two farms over, and that the spoon in the sugar jar had been put back at an angle she didn’t approve of.

She didn’t like mornings. She tolerated them. Tolerated them like she tolerated people who said “you look tired” as if it were a helpful observation.

The fire in the grate had given up some time ago and was now sulking in embers. The kettle had long since decided it wasn’t boiling until someone respected it. And the cat, which technically wasn’t hers, was attempting to blend into the shadows in a way that suggested it had something to confess and didn’t want to.

The wind knocked, politely.

Granny Weatherwax’s left eyebrow twitched. A polite wind. That was never a good sign.

She opened one eye. The blue in it was sharp enough to split wood. The other eye remained closed, because it knew what was good for it.

“Not now,” she said aloud to the silence. “I’ve not had tea.”

But the wind kept knocking, and this time it brought with it the faintest scent of beeswax, static, and something else—something new. Not new like spring, or like babies, or like that blasted soap Magrat had tried to make that one time.

New like a question that hadn’t been asked yet.

Granny Weatherwax sat up slowly, the kind of slowly that made Time itself pause and make sure it had packed a sandwich. Her boots waited by the door like dogs who knew better than to whimper. She didn’t look at them. They’d come when they were needed.

She stood.

Out beyond the forest, over the next hill and the next, something had started thinking. Not quite dreaming. Not quite plotting. But thinking, like a spark thinks before it becomes a fire.

Granny didn’t know what it was.

She just knew it was.

She reached for her hat.

And somewhere, very far away, the wind remembered its manners — and bowed.
