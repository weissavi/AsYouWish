Emotional rock ballad with raw male vocals, slow build to powerful chorus. Melodic electric guitars, heavy drums. Vibe: dark stage, red lights, surrender, longing, and haunting passion.


She spread her butt — I lost my breath,  
One glance from her was life or death.  
Her gaze said kneel, my knees obeyed,  
I bit my lip. She smiled. I stayed.  

She dragged her bat, the floor went cold,  
Her laugh was sugar laced with bold.  
A cherry whip, a velvet chain —  
I wore my shame and loved the pain.  

She tapped the bat against the floor,  
My heart beat faster than before.  
“Don’t move,” she said — I didn’t dare,  
Her grin cut through the heavy air.  

I'm her plaything, her quiet storm,  
She bends my mind and keeps me warm.  
A snap, a grin, I crawl again —  
Her throne? My back. Her love? My bane.  

She kissed me once, then pulled my hair,  
Said, “Good boys know just when to care.”  
No blood, no bruises — just control,  
She writes her name upon my soul.  

I’m her shadow, her sweetest toy,  
She breaks me slow, then calls it joy.  
Her scent, her smirk — they make me high,  
I beg to serve, and never ask why.
