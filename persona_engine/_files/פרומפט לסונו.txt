"Powerful emotional rock ballad with a driving rhythm and intense female vocals. The singer's voice is still bell-like and clear, but now full of raw energy and passion. Mid-to-fast tempo, with strong electric guitars, pounding drums, and a soaring chorus that feels like it was made to be screamed during a high-speed drive. Lyrics about heartbreak, defiance, and the refusal to numb out. No soft whispers â€” this is a battle cry from a wounded heart. Sung in English, with epic cinematic energy, ready to blast from a car stereo at full volume."
